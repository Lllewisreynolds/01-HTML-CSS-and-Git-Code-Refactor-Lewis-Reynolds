# <HTML & CSS Refactor - Improved Accessiblity>

## Description

This site had been refactored to make it more accessible, and cleaned up to leave the code a little cleaner than when I found it. The motivation behind building this project is two-fold: to both improve SEO-optimisation though reorientation of its code so as to draw in greater web traffic, whilst also taking into consideration the needs of those people with disabilities who can only fully access the site with the assistance of technologies like screen readers. This is also a preventative measure, to stop potential legal troubles from arising in instances where people find themselves unable to access the site as a result of missing best-practice functionality that could be construed as enabling potentially discriminatory practices.

This has been achieved through the following measures:

1. Addition of a concise, descriptive title in header.
 
2. Semantic HTML substituted in where appropriate to replace non-descriptive tags like <div>.

3. Alt tags added for all icons and images present in case of failures to load or accessibliity issues.

4. Logical structure institued in HTML file: headers in order, section containers clearly delineated, etc,.

5. Logical structure likewise followed in CSS by putting code in a sequential order that mirrors HTML. Redundant code also excised in CSS with the use of combined stylings/selectors, along with properly commented messages to explain changes instituted.
CSS file is properly commented with descriptive commit messages.
